<h1>Tech Startup Logos: Creating Distinctive Representation</h1>
<h2>What makes a great tech startup logo? There are three things that you should put in mind. The logo has to be distinctive, memorable and simple.</h2> 
<p>What makes a great logo?</p> 
<p>A logo is the visual representation of your business. You cannot create it in haste. It’s something that you have to really think about.</p> 
<p><a href="https://store.ramotion.com/blog/tech-startup-logos/">Tech startup logos</a>, too, have to be different. Since you are talking about a technology-based startup here, your logo should also be more techy.</p> 
<p>You might be tempted to just use your name as the logo. If you can, though, it might be better to have a visual logo instead. Besides, when you put up your logo, as long as the format or space allows, you can have both the logo and name on it.</p> 
<p>For example, most storefronts, if you have a physical store, would carry both the name and the actual logo. The same could be done with stationeries or even advertisements.</p> 
<p>When you have to create an icon, though, the visual logo would suffice.</p> 
<p>But if you have to use the visual logo alone, it has to be something that people will easily recognize.</p> 
<p>How do you create a tech startup logo?</p>
<h3>Tech startup logos</h3>
<p>Investing in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/06/24/the-most-important-thing-a-digital-agency-can-do-to-keep-its-clients/?sh=396279eb36d2" rel="nofollow">design agency</a> can really take you a long way. If you have to launch a tech startup, you should be prepared financially.</p> 
<p>As such, you should set aside a substantial amount for hiring a design agency. The firm can do a lot for you. That would include creating your logo.</p> 
<p>The logo is the visual representation of your company. That’s why it has to be done right. You don’t want to change your logo every couple of years, do you?</p>
<p>Even if you want to because you want to keep up with the trend, it’s not advisable. When you do that, you will lose the identity of your business.</p> 
<p>Consistency is important especially if you want your company to be in the business for a long time.</p> 
<p>But if you have to create a logo by yourself, you should know the top three characteristics of a logo:</p>
<h4>A brand logo has to be distinctive.</h4>
<p>Every person wants to be unique, right? Be it in physical features or in personality. Nobody wants to be stereotyped.</p> 
<p>That should also be your goal as a tech company or as a company in general. You want to be the first thing people think about when your industry is mentioned.</p> 
<p>In the same manner, you want people to immediately refer to your company even if they just take a glimpse of your logo.</p> 
<p>That’s what it means to have a truly distinctive logo. One way to have a distinctive logo is to actually create one that is attractive.</p> 
<p>When something is attractive, that usually sticks to people’s mind.</p> 
<p>But what constitutes an attractive logo? Using a bright color will also attract people. But you can’t just choose the brightest color you can find. This color should also be appropriate for your brand.</p> 
<p>Plus, this color should look good on any surface. Remember that your logo is the company’s visual representation. This means that the logo should look good on anything.</p> 
<p>For example, the logo is going to be in the storefront or office. Since you will be using a bright color, the logo should not blind people if it’s going to be created in a large scale.</p> 
<p>The logo should get on quite well on paper, too. The logo will spend a lot of time on paper. And if you have to use black-and-white print, the logo should retain that identifiable aura.</p> 
<h4>A logo must be memorable.</h4>
<p>When the logo is distinctive, there is a higher chance of it being memorable, too. But that’s not always true.</p> 
<p>Aside from having a distinctive feature, it should also be something that people will think of even if they haven’t seen the logo anymore.</p> 
<p>One way to really make a logo memorable is if it is significant to the brand.</p> 
<p>This is easier to explain if we put examples. Let’s take a look at two of the most popular web browsers: Google and Mozilla Firefox. The Google logo is simple enough to remember, it’s a colorful G.</p> 
<p>But what of Firefox? When you look at the logo, you will see a fox encircling a globe. The tail looks like a fire. Quite simple enough, right? Fire and fox will get you Firefox.</p> 
<p>The interesting thing about it is that the logo was supposed to show a red panda surrounding a globe. But of course, people saw it as a fox instead. But that’s a story for another day.</p>
<p>The Firefox logo is memorable because even if you forget the name of the company, the logo will remind you of it.</p> 
<p>That’s something you should aim for your logo as well. It should remind people of your brand and what it represents.</p> 
<p>In the case of the Firefox, the logo will tell you that Firefox is there to help you navigate the world—or the World Wide Web.</p> 
<p>Creating a logo is really a lengthy process. It should not be something that you do on a whim or just because there is a thing that you love most in the world.</p> 
<p>The logo should have a story. In order for it to be effective and memorable, it should have a significant tie to what your company wants to represent in the world.</p> 
<p>The logo is not just a visual representation of your tech startup. It should also represent the values of the brand.</p> 
<h4>The logo design should be simple.</h4>
<p>The most popular logos in the world are usually the simplest. Apple and Nike are probably among the most distinctive and memorable logos right now. They are also very simple.</p> 
<p>Less is more totally encapsulates the logo game.</p> 
<p>Having a simple logo also makes it more versatile. You can put the logo anywhere you want, as it should be, without thinking about how it would stand out while blending in.</p> 
<p>There are so many things you can do with a simple logo. There is also that notion that it will be simple to remember and would be easily recognized by consumers.</p> 
<p>But if you’re truly creative, the simple designs don’t have to be boring. The Instagram logo, for example, is a simplistic camera. It used to be an image of a camera but has since been changed to a much simpler rendering of a camera but with brighter colors.</p> 
<p>It may be a simple logo but it tells you everything you need to know about Instagram. It’s an image-sharing site, hence, the camera icon. You don’t even need the name Instagram anymore just to identify the logo.</p>
